I come from a small town in southern Italy, named Benevento where I studied towards my High School Diploma in Mathematics and Physics. Although there is a strong emotional connection with my town, I have always wanted to travel, to study in a different city and to meet as many people as possible. For this reason, I moved to Milan soon after high school to study finance. Before engaging in the Bachelor in International Economics and Finance, I had no idea of what finance was about but I had the gut feeling that this field could have been very interesting to me. My first trip to London was eye opening in this perspective. Indeed, I remember walking in the City and looking at all those people in their suits, rushing to get lunch and thinking: "Wow I want to be like them". Back in Italy, I started searching for good Business Schools in Europe and a couple of years later, I applied to Bocconi and got in. I am still working towards being that person in the City of London and right now, I am trying to boost my knowledge and networking skills here at LBS.
