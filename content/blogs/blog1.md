This year I have been an intern at UniCredit in their sales and trading department. In particular, I worked with the interest rates derivatives sales team. At work, I have never been bored, not even one single day. I was engaged in every phase of deal making, from pitching the client to the execution of the trade with the trader. This experience has been challenging but rewarding and has left me with many contacts in the bank and a couple of good friends. The technical and quantitative nature of the role is the think that I liked the most, together with the possibility of working on deals from Day 1. Reach me on Linkedin to talk about this position!
